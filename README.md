A fast, searchable API for RaceRoom Racing Experience leaderboard data.

## Core Features

- Fast cache loading (~2 seconds)
- Progressive data fetching with incremental cache updates
- Instant search using in-memory index
- Automatic scheduled nightly refresh (configurable)
- Per-track refresh status and resume-capable refreshes after restart

## API Coverage:

- 169 tracks × 83 classes = 14,027 combinations
- 45,000+ drivers searchable
- 200,000+ leaderboard entries

## Clean Architecture:

- Modular design ready for auth
- Proper error handling
- Production-grade logging
- Resource leak-free

## Quick Start

1. Build (PowerShell)

```powershell
go build -o bin/r3e-leaderboard.exe .
```

2. Run

```powershell
.\bin\r3e-leaderboard.exe
```

By default the server listens on `http://localhost:8080` and will load cached data quickly, build a searchable index, and continue fetching/refreshing data in background.

### 3. Search for Drivers
Open in browser or use PowerShell:
```powershell
# Browser
http://localhost:8080/api/search?driver=Ludo%20Flender

# PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/search?driver=Ludo Flender"
```

## 📋 API Endpoints

### Search for Driver
```
GET /api/search?driver=name[&class=classID]
```
Returns all leaderboard entries for a driver across all tracks and classes, grouped by driver name. Optionally, filter results by car class ID using the `class` parameter.

**Rate Limit:** 60 requests per minute per IP address.

**Example:**
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/search?driver=Ludo Flender&class=8600"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "found": true,
  "query": "Ludo Flender",
  "results": [
    {
      "driver": "ludo flender",
      "entries": [
        {
          "name": "Ludo Flender",
          "position": 8,
          "lap_time": "1m 23.414s, +01.887s",
          "time_diff": 1.887,
          "country": "Belgium",
          "car": "Porsche 911 RSR 2019",
          "car_class": "GTE",
          "class_name": "GTE",
          "team": "Porsche Motorsport",
          "rank": "",
          "difficulty": "Get Real",
          "track": "Brands Hatch Grand Prix - Grand Prix",
          "track_id": "9473",
          "class_id": "8600",
          "total_entries": 25
        }
        // ... more entries for this driver ...
      ]
    }
    // ... more driver groups if multiple matches ...
  ],
  "search_time": "< 1ms",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `name` - Driver name
- `position` - Position in leaderboard (1-based)
- `lap_time` - Formatted lap time with gap to leader
- `time_diff` - Time difference from leader in seconds (0.0 = leader)
- `country` - Driver's country
- `car` - Car model used
- `car_class` - Car class abbreviation
- `class_name` - Full car class name
- `team` - Team/livery name (empty if none)
- `rank` - Driver rank: A, B, C, D, or empty (no rank)
- `difficulty` - Difficulty setting: "Get Real", "Amateur", or "Novice"
- `track` - Track name and layout
- `track_id` - RaceRoom track ID
- `class_id` - RaceRoom class ID
- `total_entries` - Total number of entries in that leaderboard

**Grouping and Sorting:**
- Results are grouped by driver name (case-insensitive).
- Each group is sorted by `time_diff` ascending (0 = best/lap leader).
- If two entries have the same `time_diff`, the one with higher `total_entries` comes first.
- If `class` is provided, only results for that class ID are included.

### Server Status

GET /api/status

Shows server health, data statistics, total indexed drivers, fetch timing, and per-track refresh statuses.

**Rate Limit:** 60 requests per minute per IP address.

**Example:**
```
http://localhost:8080/api/status
```

**Response fields include:**
- `server` - status, version, data_loaded
- `data` - tracks loaded, entries, progress, etc. (now includes `total_indexed_drivers` after `unique_tracks`)
- `cache` - cache status

### Refresh Data

POST /api/refresh

POST /api/refresh?trackID=9473

Starts a background refresh. Without `trackID` it refreshes all tracks; with `trackID` it refreshes only that track. The endpoint immediately returns a JSON response indicating that the refresh started in background.

Note: In production you should secure this endpoint (API key / auth). The server writes per-track statuses to `cache/track_status.json` and logs to `./log/`.

### Clear Cache
```
POST /api/clear
```
Removes all cached data. Next startup will fetch everything fresh (~6 hours).

**Note:** This endpoint will be admin-only in production (API key required).

### Get Leaderboard for Track/Class
```
GET /api/leaderboard?track=<trackID>&class=<classID>
```
Returns the full leaderboard for a single track/class combination, sorted by performance (fastest first).

**Rate Limit:** 60 requests per minute per IP address.

**Example:**
```
http://localhost:8080/api/leaderboard?track=9473&class=8600
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "track": "Brands Hatch Grand Prix - Grand Prix",
  "track_id": "9473",
  "class_id": "8600",
  "class_name": "GTE",
  "total_entries": 25,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Ludo Flender",
      "position": 8,
      "lap_time": "1m 23.414s, +01.887s",
      "time_diff": 1.887,
      "country": "Belgium",
      "car": "Porsche 911 RSR 2019",
      "car_class": "GTE",
      "team": "Porsche Motorsport",
      "rank": "",
      "difficulty": "Get Real",
      "track": "Brands Hatch Grand Prix - Grand Prix",
      "track_id": "9473",
      "class_id": "8600",
      "total_entries": 25
    }
    // ... more entries ...
  ]
}
```

### Top Track/Class Combinations
```
GET /api/top-combinations
GET /api/top-combinations?track=<trackID>
GET /api/top-combinations?class=<classID>
GET /api/top-combinations?track=<trackID>&class=<classID>
```
Returns the top 1000 track/class combinations by entry count (descending), or the top combinations for a specific track.

You can now filter by `class` to get combinations only for a specific car class, and you can combine both `track` and `class` to get the exact pairing.

**Rate Limit:** 60 requests per minute per IP address.

**Examples:**
```
http://localhost:8080/api/top-combinations               # top 1000 combinations overall
http://localhost:8080/api/top-combinations?track=9473     # top combinations for track 9473
http://localhost:8080/api/top-combinations?class=8600     # top combinations for class 8600 across all tracks
http://localhost:8080/api/top-combinations?track=9473&class=8600  # specific track+class pairing
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 1000,
  "results": [
    {
      "track": "Brands Hatch Grand Prix - Grand Prix",
      "track_id": "9473",
      "class_id": "8600",
      "class_name": "GTE",
      "entry_count": 25
    }
    // ... more combinations ...
  ]
}
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Initial Startup (First Run)
1. Server starts immediately on port 8080
2. Fetches all 14,027 track/class combinations from RaceRoom API (~6 hours)
3. Uses pagination to get complete results (handles 1500+ entry leaderboards)
4. Saves data to local cache (`cache/` directory)
5. Updates search index every 5 minutes during fetch
6. API is searchable throughout the entire process

### Subsequent Startups (With Cache)
1. Loads cached data in ~2 seconds
2. Builds search index immediately
3. **API is ready to search in ~3 seconds**
4. Fetches missing/expired data in background

### Search Results
- **Instant search** (< 1ms) using in-memory index
- **Sorted by performance** - fastest times first
- **Complete driver data** - team, rank, difficulty, time gaps
- **Case-insensitive** - finds "ludo flender" or "LUDO FLENDER"
- **Partial matches** - searches for partial names

### Automatic Refresh
- Runs daily at 4:00 AM (configurable)
- Updates data progressively (no downtime)
- Refreshes index every 100 tracks
- API stays responsive throughout

## Cache & Logs

### Cache Location
```
cache/
├── track_9473/
│   ├── class_1703.json.gz   # Brands Hatch + GT3
│   ├── class_1704.json.gz   # Brands Hatch + GT2
│   └── ...
├── track_10394/
│   └── ...
└── fetch_timestamps.json
```

### Cache Validity
- Cache files are compressed JSON under `cache/track_<id>/class_<id>.json.gz` and expire after 24 hours by default.
- During refresh the cache is updated incrementally so an interrupted run will not lose already-fetched data. On restart the refresh resumes from previously-created cache files.

### Logs
- Refresh and server events are appended to daily files in `./log/YYYY-MM-DD.log`. Important events and errors are written there.

### Emails
- The server can send emails for refresh start/end, but email sending is optional. If SMTP is not configured via environment variables, the server will skip sending emails and only log the intent to send.

Environment variables for SMTP (optional): `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM`.

## Common Commands

### Development
```powershell
# Build application
go build -o bin/r3e-leaderboard.exe .

# Run server
.\bin\r3e-leaderboard.exe

# Build and run (quick test)
go run main.go
```

### API Usage
```powershell

```

## 📝 Configuration

This project does not currently read a `config.json` file from disk. Instead, default configuration values are provided by the code in `internal.GetDefaultConfig()` (see `internal/config.go`). To change runtime settings, modify `internal/config.go` or adapt the code to read configuration from a file or environment variables.

Default values:
 - Server port: `8080`
 - Scheduled refresh hour: `4` (4:00 AM)
 - Indexing frequency: `2` minutes

If you prefer a file-based config, you can add a small loader that reads JSON and merges with defaults.
```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 8080
  },
  "schedule": {
    "refresh_hour": 4,
    "indexing_minutes": 5
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```
❌ Failed to start HTTP server: listen tcp :8080: bind: Only one usage of each socket address
```
**Solution:** Change port by editing `internal.GetDefaultConfig()` (or set up a proper config loader), or stop other application using port 8080.

### Missing Data After Interrupted Refresh
**No data lost!** The refresh system preserves existing cache. Just restart and it will continue from where it left off.

### Rate Limit Exceeded
```
❌ Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.
```
**Cause:** More than 60 search requests in 1 minute from your IP.  
**Solution:** Wait 1 minute and try again. Consider caching results on your end if making frequent searches.

### Slow Search Results
**Normal on first search.** Index builds on startup. Subsequent searches are instant (< 1ms).
